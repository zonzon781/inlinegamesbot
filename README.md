## Deploying

### Heroku

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

Use this button to begin deployment:  
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/jacklul/inlinegamesbot)

Assuming everything was entered correctly your bot should be instantly working - if it's not you should try running `php bin/console post-install` inside the app.

You will also want to add **Heroku Scheduler** addon and set up a hourly task to run the following command to clean up expired games from the database:
- `php bin/console cron`

_If this command times out too fast try using something like this instead: `php -d max_execution_time=2700 bin/console cron`_

## Note on translations

Translations support is implemented but it is not used mainly because translated text would be displayed to both players - this could be problematic in "gaming" groups - people setting language that other player can't understand!
